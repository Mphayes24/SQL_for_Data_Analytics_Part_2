1. From the job_postings_fact table, categorize the salaries from job postings that are data analyst jobs and who have a yearly salary information. 
Put salary into 3 different categories:

SELECT
  job_id,
  job_title,
  salary_year_avg,
  CASE 
    WHEN salary_year_avg > 100000 THEN 'High salary'
		WHEN salary_year_avg BETWEEN 60000 and 99999 THEN 'Standard salary'
    WHEN salary_year_avg < 60000 THEN 'Low salary'
  END AS salary_category
FROM 
	job_postings_fact
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    and job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;

2. Count the number of unique companies that offer work from home (WFH) versus those requiring work to be on-site. 
Use the job_postings_fact table to count and compare the distinct companies based on their WFH policy (job_work_from_home).

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN job_work_from_home = TRUE THEN company_id END) AS wfh_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN job_work_from_home = FALSE THEN company_id END) AS non_wfh_companies
FROM job_postings_fact;

3. For experience_level, categorize jobs based on keywords found in their titles (job_title) as 'Senior', 'Lead/Manager', 'Junior/Entry', or 'Not Specified'. 
Assume that certain keywords in job titles (like "Senior", "Manager", "Lead", "Junior", or "Entry") can indicate the level of experience required. 
ILIKE should be used in place of LIKE for this. For remote_option, specify whether a job offers a remote option as either 'Yes' or 'No', based on job_work_from_home column.

SELECT 
  job_id,
  salary_year_avg,
  CASE
      WHEN job_title ILIKE '%Senior%' THEN 'Senior'
      WHEN job_title ILIKE '%Manager%' OR job_title ILIKE '%Lead%' THEN 'Lead/Manager'
      WHEN job_title ILIKE '%Junior%' OR job_title ILIKE '%Entry%' THEN 'Junior/Entry'
      ELSE 'Not Specified'
  END AS experience_level,
  CASE
      WHEN job_work_from_home THEN 'Yes'
      ELSE 'No' 
  END AS remote_option
FROM 
  job_postings_fact
WHERE 
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 
  job_id;
